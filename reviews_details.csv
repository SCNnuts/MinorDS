His place is extremely clean, and he provides everything you could possibly want (comfy bed, guidebooks & maps, mini-fridge, towels, even toiletries). He is extremely friendly and helpful, and will go out of his way to help you if needed, or just let you come and go as you please. Highly recommended!"

Maps, towels, mini-fridge, coffee (very tasty) and tea supplies were provided. Bathroom with all the bathroom requires. Good location - next to the tram stop and it took just around 10-15 minutes to get to the city center.
Totally recommendable! "

It is also convenient to buses and trams which will take you around the city in minutes.  You will truly feel like a local here.
